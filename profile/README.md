**Scrivener** is a Windows-based writing environment designed for managing complex, long-form writing projects. It provides a flexible structure that allows users to break large texts into manageable sections while maintaining a clear overview of the entire work.

The application is widely used for books, research papers, scripts, and structured documentation. Its workspace focuses on organization, idea development, and iterative writing rather than linear text editing alone.
